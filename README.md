# Mapping Earthquakes
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to use the Mapbox API and leaflet to construct a map displaying earthquakes. 
The map has the following features:
- The ability to switch the map overlay between earthquakes, major earthquakes, and tectonic plates. Overlays can be shown all at once, or once at a time.
- The ability to switch the tile layer between streets, satellite, and dark mode.
- A legend showing earthquake magnitude,
- Circles that represent earthquakes with radius based on magnitude.
- Popups for each earthquake showing magnitude and location.
- Lines showing tectonic plate edges.
